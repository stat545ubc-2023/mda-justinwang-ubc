# STAT 545A Mini Data-Analysis Deliverable 1
Author: _Yi Wang_

## _Project description_ 
This is my Data Analysis Project in R. The dataset I analyzed is parking_meters: Acquired courtesy of The City of Vancouverâ€™s Open Data Portal. It currently has 10032 rows and 22 columns. And the research question I want to investigate are:  

 1. Is there any correlation between the acceptance of credit cards at parking meters and the average morning parking rates they charge?

 2. What is the distribution of morning parking rates (r_mf_9a_6p) for parking meters located in different geographic areas (geo_local_area)? Are there significant differences in pricing patterns across neighborhoods?

 3. Are there differences in morning parking rates (r_mf_9a_6p) between weekdays (Mon-Fri) and weekends (Sat-Sun) for different meter types (meter_head)?

 4. Do parking meters with longer time limits (t_mf_9a_6p) tend to have higher morning parking rates (r_mf_9a_6p)? This question explores whether there is a relationship between the duration of time allowed for parking and the associated rates.
